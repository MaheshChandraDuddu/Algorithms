# Question: 
Shino has to travel from cell (1,1) to cell (N,M) in a grid of size Nâˆ—M.
Some special candies are kept  in some K special cells of the grid, where each candy has an amount of happiness associated with it.Each cell can have a different happiness quotient. 
Shino can travel only in right and down direction in the grid, as he is too careful and does not want to fall out of grid. Now, we call the value of a path the happiness of all cells lying on the path. All non-special cells have happiness equal to 0. Now, you need to find and print the value of the path having highest happiness quotient, traveling only right and down to an adjacent cell.
